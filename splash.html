        <p>This facility displays places that you may wish to use to start a walk. The places are those that Ramblers
            walks have used in the past. Many of these will be car parks suitable for either starting a walk or for car sharing.
            PLEASE note that while Ramblers Groups have used these locations it DOES NOT mean that 
            they are suitable for your use. </p>
        <p>By clicking on the <a href="index.php?option=display" >Continue</a> button below 
            you are agreeing that you will check the suitability of locations before 
            you use them.</p>
        <p>You can also view places that have been flagged as no longer suitable, by clicking on <a href="index.php?option=display&rejected=1" >Rejected places</a> 
        </p>
