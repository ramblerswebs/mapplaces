        <p>This facility displays the meeting and starting places that Ramblers Groups have used on their walks. 
        It can be used to find places from which to start a walk, BUT please note that 
        while Ramblers Groups have used these locations it DOES NOT mean that 
        they are suitable for your use. </p>
        <p>By clicking on the <a href="index.php?option=display" >Continue</a> button below 
        you are agreeing that you will check the suitability of locations before 
        you use them.</p>
        <p>You can also view places that have been flagged as no longer suitable, by clicking on <a href="index.php?option=display&rejected=1" >Rejected places</a>
