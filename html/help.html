            <p>Groups within the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.ramblers.org.uk">Ramblers</a> 
                lead walks all across the UK. 
                Details of each walk are published on the 
                <a target="_blank" href="http://links.ramblers-webs.org.uk/walksfinder.php">Ramblers walks finder</a>. 
                This facility lets you view the Meeting places and Starting places that walks have used in the past.
                Many of these locations (meeting and starting) may be useful for you when planning a walk.</p>
            <p>PLEASE note that while Ramblers Groups have used these locations it DOES NOT mean that they are suitable for your use.

By using this facility you are agreeing that you will check the suitability of locations before you use them.</p>

                <li>The location of each place is identified by the use of an Ordnance Survey <a href="index.php?option=gridrefpage">Grid Reference</a>.</li>
                <li>The mapping function on the following page will show clusters of 
                    locations around the UK.</li>
                <li>Hover mouse over a cluster to see its bounds and click a cluster to zoom to those bounds.</li>
                <li>Click on a marker to see its Grid Reference. A list of descriptions and [when used] will be displayed.</li>
                <li>You can change the type of map displayed by using the top right button.</li>
                <li>If the location / grid reference is wrong then you can report this.</li>
                <li>To add a new place, lead a Ramblers walk from there and get it listed on <a href="http://links.ramblers-webs.org.uk/walksfinder.php" target="_blank">Walks Finder</a>.</li>
