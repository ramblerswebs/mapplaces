        <h4>What is a Grid Reference?</h4>
        <p>A grid reference is a way of defining a location within Great Britain. 
            It is usually an eight character item of the form  
            <br> [2 Grid letters] [3 figures(easting)] [3 figures(northing)]<br> 
            where the 2 Grid letters are the position in the picture on the right and the figures define a 
            location to within 100 metres.</p>

    <h4>How to define a Grid Reference</h4>
    <p>The Ordnance Survey Grid Reference System lets you define any UK location 
        through the use of a map reference conforming to the following convention: <br> 
        <br> [2 Grid letters] [3 figures(easting)] [3 figures(northing)]<br>
        <br> To arrive at this map reference, the United Kingdom is first divided into a series 
        of 100km squares. <br> <br> Each 100km square is then given a unique two letter code such 
        as NT, SU, TQ,  etc.<br> <br></p>
    <img title="Map of Wales showing 100km OS grid structure" src="images/img00002.gif" 
         alt="Map of Wales showing 100km OS grid structure" class='imgLeft' 
         height="296" width="240">
    Wales, for instance,&nbsp; is covered by eight 100km squares. 
    <p> The approximate extent of each of these 100km squares is illustrated on the      left. </p>
    <p> Therefore the grid reference for any location in Wales always starts with
        one of the following:</p>
    <p>
        SH, SJ, SM, SN, SO, SR, SS, ST
    </p>
    <p>This indicates within which particular 100km square the location is to be found.
    </p>
    <p>Much greater accuracy is of course required if the grid reference system is to be 
        of any practical value. Each two letter 100km square is therefore subdivided by 
        vertical and horizontal grid lines, at 10km intervals, to produce one hundred 10km squares.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><br> <br> 
        <img title="Map showing subdivision of 100km Square SN" src="images/img00003.gif" 
             alt="Map showing subdivision of 100km Square SN" 
             class='imgLeft'  height="229" width="240">
        <br> The vertical line forming the left hand side of the 100km square is labelled zero. 
        Each successive vertical grid line within the 100km square is labelled in kilometres. 
        <br> <br> The horizontal line forming the bottom of the 100km square is also labelled zero. 
        Each successive horizontal grid line within the 100km square is labelled in kilometres. 
        <br> Any intersection of a vertical and horizontal line within square SN is therefore so many 
        kilometres east of that squareâ€˜s zero point (the easting), and so many kilometres north of that 
        same zero point (the northing). <br> <br> The centre point of square SN could therefore be said
        to have a grid reference of SN 50 50. <br> 
        <br> Each 10km square within the SN square is then further
        subdivided into a hundred 1km squares.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

        The diagram on the left is an enlarged view of the four 10km squares in the bottom left hand 
        corner of the SN square shown above. <br> <br> The first 10km square is subdivided by vertical 
        and horizontal grid lines at 1km intervals. <br> 
        <br> The centre point of this 10km square could be said to have a grid reference
        of SN 05 05. <br> <br> To accurately establish the grid reference of the adjacent black dot
        , a further 10 x 10 grid must be superimposed on the 1km square within which the dot is located.
        <br> <br> The dot can then be seen to be 4.5km east of zero (easting), and 5.5km north
        of zero (northing) within grid SN. <br> <br> So its grid reference would be SN 045 055. <br> 
        <br></p>

    <h3>Ordnance Survey Maps</h3>
    <p>Explorer maps are amongst the most useful, for walking, 
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/">Ordnance Survey</a> maps published. 
        <img title="Example of Explorer map" 
             src="images/exp_024_map_2015-05_west.jpg" 
             alt="Example of Explorer map" 
             class='imgRight'  height="250" width="250">
        They use a scale of 1:25 000 (4cm to 1km), and follow the general principal of the grid system
        discussed above. <br> <br> If only one 100km square is covered by a map, the two letter code
        for that square can usually be found in each corner of the map. If more than one 100km square
        is covered, the relevant two letter codes are usually clearly printed where the 100km squares
        meet. <br> <br> Each 10km square shown on a map is further subdivided into 
        one hundred 1 km squares. The squares are formed from blue grid lines, spaced 1 km apart. <br>
        <br> The eastings are marked along the top and bottom edges of each map, and the  northings 
        down the sides of each map. <br> <br> When defining a location, 
        like the start of a walk, use the following  convention for all OS Grid References: 
        <br> [2 Grid letters] [3 figures(easting)] [3 figures(northing)]</p>
